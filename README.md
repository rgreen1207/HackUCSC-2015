# Senior Citizen Aid Device
This project is being tackled by Team CSUMB at the 2015 Hack UCSC hackathon. We are representatives, alongside mentors, aiming to develop an application to help elderly individuals in navigating the house as well as serving as an emergency system to detect possible falls and injuries. We will accomplish this using the Plantronics wearable device "Concept One" API and the Tessel microcontroller.
