    Elderly Integrated Care Device is a system developed for helping assisted living facilities receive and send important data vital to emergency and medical applications. Our system is developed off the Plantronics WC1 Headset and is integrated with Android and a web application to offer clients instant detailed notifications of important information such as a patient falling to the floor or how much exercise they are getting on a daily basis. This demonstration was developed to display the high potential that this headset has to help patients, care providers, and doctors alike. The headset has a wide array of sensors and when paired with the second half of our project, the Tessel, it can have an almost unlimited amount of potential features such as proximity sensing, video recording, and a wide array of automation commands which integrates with a plethora of existing technologies.
